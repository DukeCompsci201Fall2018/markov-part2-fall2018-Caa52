This is the analysis for Markov Part 2, Fall 2018

(1) Determine (from running Benchmark.java) how long it takes for 
BaseMarkov to generate 2,000, 4,000, 8,000, 16,000, and 32,000 
random characters using the default file and an order 5 Markov Model. 
Include these timings in your report. 
The program also generates 4,096 characters using texts that increase in 
size from 496,768 characters to 4,967,680 characters (10 times the number).  
Do you the timings support the O(NT) analysis for BaseMarkov?


Answer: #1

# of Characters          Amount of Time it took BaseMarkov to generate
2000               =      0.216
4000               =      0.376
8000               =      0.816
16000              =      1.513
32000              =      2.932

Yes the timings support the O(NT) analysis for BaseMarkov



(2) Determine (from running Benchmark.java) how long it takes for 
EfficientMarkov to generate 2,000, 4,000, 8,000, 16,000, and 32,000 
random characters using the default file and an order 5 Markov Model. 
Include these timings in your report. 
The program also generates 4,096 characters using texts that increase in 
size from 496,768 characters to 4,967,680 characters (10 times the number).  
Do you the timings support the O(N+T) analysis for EfficientMarkov?


Answer: #2

# of Characters          Amount of Time it takes EfficientMarkov to generate
2000               =      0.198
4000               =      0.357
8000               =      0.721
16000              =      1.224
32000              =      2.968

No the timings do not support the O(N +T) analysis for Efficient Markov

(3)The tests in the class Benchmark use an order-5 Markov Model. 
Run tests that you think are appropriate to determine if the order of the 
Markov Model has a significant impact on the running time for BaseMarkov. 
Explain your reasoning.
